= The Lecharny Challenge

image:https://travis-ci.org/melix/lecharny-challenge.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/melix/lecharny-challenge"]

The goal of this repository is to check the performance of various implementations of an algorithm that:

* given an input string
* replaces all sequences of `\r\n `, `\n\r `, `\r ` or `\n ` with an empty string

Algorithm *must* be run in the JVM.

= Executing the benchmark

----
./gradlew jmh
----

= Correctness

The current version of the repository doesn't check the correctness of the algorithms. Some have been proposed which
are *incorrect*!

Unit tests can be launched with:

----
./gradlew test
----

= Integration with IntelliJ

To use in IntelliJ, first run:

----
./gradlew idea
----

Then open the generated project.
